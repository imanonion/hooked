My first repository on Github *nervous fingernail biting*

One fine day, while searching for a game to reproduce for my first project, I stumbled upon the fun but _competitive_ game: [Hook and Ring Toss Battle Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePp2F2_2RDQ)

I've tweaked the layout of the game, but the goal remains the same - Get the hook to the counter closest to your opponent!

Instructions:
1. **Player 1** on the left will "pull" the rope by pressing down key **A**, while **Player 2** on the right will "pull" the rope by pressing down key **L**.
2. Release the key and let it swing towards the middle
3. If the circle at the end of the rope touches the circle in the middle, then the hook will move one counter towards your opponent (and away from you)
4. Keep going until your counter lands on the counter closest to your opponent!

May the best Hooker win!!
